In this program we use search Strategy as interface.Using Interface helps us implement multiple inheritance without effecting the main code.
In this program we implemented three staregies to find the coordinates of the ship.Here we used three strategies to find the ship.So by using 
the interface we can implement these three strategies in the derived class without rewriting again.So the  main advantage of interface is to 
acheive multiple inhertance and provide polymorphic behaviour in java.
